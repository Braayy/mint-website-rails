  %a(href="https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/releases/tag/0.12.0" target="_blank")
    release changelog
  which has a lot of valuable information.

%h2 Language Server

%p
  One of the highly requested features the language server is now available using the
  %code mint ls
  command.

%p
  Having this shipped allows us to incrementally implement other features such as showing errors and goto declaration / implementation.

%h3 Format on Save

%p
  The files are formatted when saved if they don't contain any errors.

= video_tag 'blog/format-on-save.mp4', controls: true

%h3 Hover Provider

%p
  The type information of most entities can be checked by hovering over them also, if available the documentation is displayed as well.

= video_tag 'blog/hover.mp4', controls: true

%h3 Completion Provider

%p
  Completions are provided for entities in stores, components, modules and also in scope variables (depending on where to cursor is).

= video_tag 'blog/completion.mp4', controls: true

%h2 Asset Directive

%p
  The asset directive allows you to reference an asset (image, stylesheet, video, etc..) - relative to the current file. These assets are bundled in the production build.

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      component Main {
        fun render : Html {
          /* The image should be in the same directory as this file. */
          <img src={@asset(some-image.jpg)}/>
        }
      }

%p
  Only those assets get bundled which are touched during type checking, for example if a component references some assets then those assets are only bundled if that component is used.

%h2 Bugfixes and Issues

%p
  %b 12 bugs and issues
  were fixed in this release.

%h2 Next steps

%p
  Please update your Mint and report any issues. We will keep moving forward and start the development focusing on 0.13.0.
