    Mint 0.11.0
  has been released!

%p
  This release focused on bug fixes, although there are some new language features.

%p
  There are
  %a(href="https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/compare/0.10.0...0.11.0" target="_blank")
    102 commits since 0.10.0
  by 5 contributors.

%p
  Letâ€™s review some highlights in this release. But donâ€™t miss out on the rest of the
  %a(href="https://github.com/mint-lang/mint/releases/tag/0.11.0" target="_blank") release changelog
  which has a lot of valuable information.

%h2 Regular Expression Literal

%p
  Mint now supports regular expression literals:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      Regexp.match("abbc", /ab+c/i) == true

%h2 Open Modules

%p
  Modules now can be defined in multiple places allowing to define constants and functions.

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      module Greeter {
        fun greet (name : String) {
          "Hello \#{name}!"
        }
      }

      module Greeter {
        fun greetPolitely (name : String) {
          "Have a nice day Mr. \#{name}!"
        }
      }

%p
  This is mostly useful if you want to extend a module in the standard library (like
  %code Array
  ).

%h2
  %code or
  operator

%p
  Added the
  %code or
  operator as an alias to
  %code Maybe.withDefault
  \:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      Maybe.withDefault("Hello", Maybe::Just("Value")) /* "Value" */
      Maybe.withDefault("Hello", Maybe::Nothing)       /* "Hello" */

      Maybe::Just("Value") or "Hello" /* "Value" */
      Maybe::Nothing or "Hello"       /* "Hello" */

%h2
  %code []
  access on tuples

%p
  It is now possible to use
  %code []
  on tuples:

%pre
  %code
    :escaped
      {"Name", "Joe"}[0] == "Name"

%p
  Only literal numbers are valid since it's the only way we can only determine the type.

%h2 Bugfixes and Issues

%p
  %b 27 bugs and issues
  were fixed in this release.

%h2 Next steps

%p
  Please update your Mint and report any issues. We will keep moving forward and start the development focusing on 0.12.0.
